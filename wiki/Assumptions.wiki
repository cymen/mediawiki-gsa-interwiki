This extension assumes that:
  * There is a collection configured on the GSA that indexes all of the Mediawiki installations and only the Mediawiki installations. Use this to configure the extension. Collections are created and configured on the GSA.
  * All of the wikis are installed in similar paths. In other words, the URL mapping is http://server_name/some_arbitrary_path/wiki_name1 with wiki_name2 and so forth at http://server_name/some_arbitrary_path/wiki_name2. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the extension to support the configuration of wikis. This is not a minor modification as the assumption is present in a number of places. Writing the extension in a manner such that this assumption is not made would have made the extension much more complex and the time could not justified (as it was not needed in our environment).
