How to install the extension.

= Introduction =

The default Mediawiki search can be replaced with one that uses results from a Google Search Appliance. This project does that and also adds support for the case in which multiple Mediawiki installations have been made and there is the need to include search results from all wikis on the search page. The search results for Page title and Page text are from the current wiki but a new box appears to the right of Page text which is for Interwiki results. This box is repurposed to contain results from other wikis which are grouped by wiki and use names for each wiki per a configuration page.

No modification of the core Mediawiki software is done. Everything is done as an extension. The configuration needs to be done on each wiki at:

* LocalSettings.php file in root of wiki
* MediaWiki:Search-interwiki-caption (special page, paste in name and edit it)
* MediaWiki:Search-interwiki-custom (special page, paste in name and edit it)
